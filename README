LAMMPS and PLUMED input files for calculation of bubble nucleation 
rates in Lennard-Jones fluids. 

The approach combines reweighted Jarzynski sampling and my recrossing
correction based on committor analysis. As such, three distinct types
of simulations are needed:
(1) Steered MD simulations (10 apiece)
(2) Equilibrium sampling under Jarzynski bias (5 apiece)
(3) Committor analysis on candidate transition state (10 apiece)

In between (1) and (2) we use the nn.py scripts to derive a bias 
potential that will enhance sampling in step (2).
Based on the FES reconstructed from step (2) we identify a candidate 
transition state/dividing surface that we subject to committor 
analysis (3), while simultaneously counting the number of recrossings 
per run, which allows us to estimate the transmission coefficient.

Note that we bias the molvol CV in step (1) and (2), but are actually
interested in a FES for coord.lessthan, which is possible in a
reweighting scheme like this. Because we define the dividing surface 
using the latter CV, we also must prepare our committor candidates 
by steered MD, biasing this CV. The molvol CV is much cheaper to 
bias, which is why we have chosen this strategy.

The specific nn.py used to generate each bias is provided in its 
respective *fes/ dir. Some minor differences in fitting ranges 
are result of a "whatever fits" strategy. Same is true for the 
upper wall used in the equilibrium sampling runs.
